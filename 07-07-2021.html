        Veteran actor Dilip Kumar died on July 7 at around 7.30 am in Mumbai. He
        was 98. Last week, he was admitted to Khar-based Hinduja Hospital after
        complaining of breathing issues. His wife Saira Banu had shared a health
        update about Dilip Kumar a few days ago and asked everyone to pray for
        his recovery. More details about Dilip Kumar's funeral will be out
        shortly.
